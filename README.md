# Tax PDF Organizer
Introduction

Welcome to the MCAccounting Tax PDF Organizer, a Python script designed to streamline the organization of tax-related PDF files. This script automates the process of checking PDF files in a specified directory for the presence of specific text ('8879') on either the first or fifth page. If the text is found, the script moves the file to a designated directory, providing a more efficient way to manage tax documents.
